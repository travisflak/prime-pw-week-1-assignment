touch
# 7 - Run 'git --version' in your terminal. What is the output?
git version 2.24.3 (Apple Git-128)
# 8 - Why would you run the command 'git status'?
The git status command displays the state of the working directory and the staging area.
It lets you see which changes have been staged, which haven't,
and which files aren't being tracked by Git.
Status output does not show you any information regarding the committed project history.
# 9 - What does the command 'git add .' do?
The git add command adds a change in the working directory to the staging area.
It tells Git that you want to include updates to a particular file in the next commit.
However, git add doesn't really affect the repository in any significant way.
Changes are not actually recorded until you run git commit.
# 10 - What is the command to push your committed changes to your repo on GitHub?
git push -u origin master
